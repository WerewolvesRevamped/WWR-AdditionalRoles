**Lamb** | Solo Miscellaneous - Horsemen Team | Temporary 
__Basics__
When the Lamb dies, the horsemen go apocalyptic. If all Horsemen are dead and the Lamb remains, the Lamb will turn into an Apocalyptic Lamb.
__Details__
The Lamb has a separate private channel with an arbitrary horseman. This channel is not the same channel as the one that horsemen share when they doom each other or go apocalyptic.
Turning into an Apocalyptic Lamb is an immediate action.
The Horsemen win when everyone else is dead.
