**Cryptographer** | Solo Killing - Solo | Temporary
__Basics__
The Cryptographer is completely alone and must kill everyone else. Each night the Cryptographer may attack a player. When they attempt to do so a random player receives a segment (around one fifth) of their nickname (with spaces removed). 
__Details__
Players that have already received a segment from a Cryptographer are twice as likely to receive another segment.
