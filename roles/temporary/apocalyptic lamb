**Apocalyptic Lamb** | Solo Killing - Horsemen Team | Temporary
__Basics__
Each night, the Apocalyptic Lamb may choose to use the ability of a horseman of their choice. The Apocalyptic Lamb is invulnerable to night attacks.
__Details__
The Apocalyptic Lamb may choose out of four abilities. The same ability can not be used twice in a row.
War: A chosen player will lose their vote during the next day. Additionally, they become unable to be elected. Should the player win the election vote, the election instead fails and nobody is elected.
Pestilence: A chosen player will be unable to use an ability during the following day and night. Any attempt to use an active ability will fail for that player.
Death: A chosen player dies at the end of the following night. This is not an attack.
Famine: A chosen player will permanently be strongly disguised as an arbitrary in-play role on the horseman team.
Using an ability is an immediate action.
The Horsemen win when everyone else is dead.
