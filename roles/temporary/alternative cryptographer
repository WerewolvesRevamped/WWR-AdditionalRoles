**Alternative Cryptographer** | Solo Killing - Cryptographer Team | Temporary
__Basics__
The Alternative Cryptographer wins when everyone else (excluding unaligned players) is dead. Each night the Alternative Cryptographer may attack a player. When they attempt to do so a random player receives a letter of their nickname (with spaces removed). 
__Details__
The Cryptographer may also invest in the stock market. Players that have already received a segment from a Alternative Cryptographer are twice as likely to receive another segment.
