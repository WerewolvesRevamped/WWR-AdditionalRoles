**Priestess** | Townsfolk Power | Temporary
__Basics__
Each night, the Priestess can attempt to remove the accursed modifier from a player.
__Details__
Each Night, the Priestess can select a player. If that player has the accursed modifier, it is removed and the Priestess is informed.
Selecting a player is an immediate action and cannot be performed on a player two nights in a row.
The curse caster who applied the accursed modifier will also be informed it was removed, but not from which player.
The Priestess can gain the accursed modifier but is not affected by it.

__Simplified__
The Priestess is a townsfolk role who can remove an accursed modifier during the night.
If an accursed modifier is removed, both the Priestess and the Curse Caster are informed, however the Curse Caster is not informed who it was removed from.
