__Details__
Evil Ts's kill can not be avoided and is an immediate effect. Evil Ts does not know the amount of players he can kill, but must specify the correct amount of players.
Evil Ts can choose to ascend any time and then wins the game immediately - unless another admin lives. If that is the case he immediately loses.
