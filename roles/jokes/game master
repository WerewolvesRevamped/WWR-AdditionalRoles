**Game Master** | GM Group | joke
__Basics__
One or more Game Master(s) will occasionally turn into a host for a game.
While a host, players may ping the specific Game Master(s) that are hosting.

__Details__
Pinging a Game Master (that is not a host) will result in death. When a Game Master chooses to host a game they become a host. 
The host is pingable and doing so will not result in death.

Game Masters don't kill players that ping them, instead the player just dies.
