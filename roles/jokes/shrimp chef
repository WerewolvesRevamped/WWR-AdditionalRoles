__Basics__

The Shrimp Chef wins with the plague team.
__Details__
Each day the Shrimp Chef will prepare a new shrimp dish, they can choose to prepare a cooked shrimp dish or a raw one, and coose a player to serve it to.
At night the customer will be given the option to eat the shrimp dish or not, the Shrimp Chef cannot talk to the customer.
Raw shrimp dishes give the player food poisoning, roleblocking them until the end of the next night, at which point the player will contract the plague.
Cooked Shrimp dishes don't do anything but are necessary, as if the Shrimp Chef's customers eat two raw shrimp dishes in a row the Shrimp Chef will be shut down and can no longer use their ability.
The Shrimp Chef cannot communicate with the rest of the plague team, however they are immune to the effects of the plague.
