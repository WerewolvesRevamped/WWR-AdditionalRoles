Luffy | GM Align | Joke
__Basics__
On the first night Luffy must choose a team to align with, if any member of that team performs an action Luffy can perform that action on another player.
__Details__
On the first night Luffy chooses any team, even if not in play, he is then aligned with that team and will only win if they do.
Whenever a member of the selected team uses an ability Luffy will be informed, he can then use that ability on another player of his choosing.
Luffy is loyal to the team of his choice and as such he can't change role or alignment after his choice has been made.
