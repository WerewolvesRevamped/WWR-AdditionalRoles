**Test** | Test Miscellaneous | Joke
__Basics__
This role is a test role, as such it is every role at once but not at the same time.
__Details__
Each phase the Test will gain the ability of an arbitrary role until the start of the next phase.
The test is aware of it's current ability.
When it uses it's ability the Test has no count or temporal restrictions, however it must use the ability that the role can do that phase.
Certain roles abilities have their own restrictions and changes however:
- Each time the Test becomes a hell team role a soul is added to the test soul pool.
- Ravenkeeper Ravens persist through Phases and information will be recieved even if the test no longer has the ability.
- Any alignment conversions turn those players into Tests.
- Any solo roles that apply an effect apply the <?glitch:question> effect, the <?glitch:question> effect works as the effect for whatever solo the test currently is.
- Roles that would interact with a type of private poll instead just act as if the Test had it's own poll already.

The Test wins if it has a win condition that is reached from a role's ability, solo effects are replaced by the <?glitch:question> effect.
