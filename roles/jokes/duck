**Duck** | Unaligned Power | Joke
  __Basics__
The Duck may quack at a player if that player quacks back the Duck gains a birdseed.
The Duck wins when they have birdseed equal to 5/9 of players.
__Details__
Each Night the Duck may select up to 3 players to quack at, if a player quacks back they lose their vote on the election poll.
The next day the Duck gains birdseed equal to players who quacked back.
When the Duck has birdseed equal to 5/9 of the starting player count (rounded up) then they ascend and win.
When the Duck ascends all players who quacked back gain a random extra role for the duration of the game, this extra role persists through death.
The extra role can be any role but without alignment.
