**Ethan** | GM Killing | Joke
__Basics__
Each game that Ethan does not play or host but is promoted results in a public poll to kill them.
Anyone who votes yes will be unable to act if they do die.
__Details__
A public poll with an arbitrary closing time will be opened to decide if Ethan should die at the start of the game.
This only occurs if Ethan is not playing or hosting.
Any player who votes yes will be unable to act for the rest of the game if Ethan does die in this way.
If the vote is no there may be more polls created until a yes vote is reached.
Ethan wins when they are killed by their own poll.
