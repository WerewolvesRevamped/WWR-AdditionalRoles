**Ethan** | GM Killing | Joke
__Basics__
If this role is in play, for each day they are alive Ethan generates a poll to kill themselves, if they die this way then they win.
Only Townsfolk can win while Ethan is alive.
__Details__
Each day that Ethan is alive a public poll to kill them is created, this poll has only two options of yes and no.
If the result of the poll is yes Ethan is killed and wins, but every participant that voted yes loses their role and becomes a none.
If the result is no, Ethan lives and every player that voted no is immune to attacks that night.
Ethan is immune to all attacks and death, except from True Kills.
While Ethan is alive only the townsfolk team may win.
This role can be applied to Ethan if they're neither participant or host but have the GM role, this is at the discression of the host.
