**Accursed** | Modifier | Variant
__Basics__
Accursed is a modifier that makes the player with it turn into a wolf if attacked by a wolfish player as if they were a cursed civilian. An Accursed + Baker will turn into a bloody butcher and bakers will become butchers. Modifiers are added onto another role.
