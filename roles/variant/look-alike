**Look-Alike** | Unaligned Align | Variant
__Basics__
The Look-Alike copies the role of another player during Night 1.
__Details__
During Night 1, the Look-Alike must choose one other player. If the Look-Alike does not copy a player in time, a target will be randomly selected for them.
The Look-Alike may not copy themself. Choosing a player to copy is an immediate ability.
The target is not told they have been copied by the Look-Alike. This means that if the Look-Alike copies a wolf, they will join the wolf ranks, but the werewolves will not be told who has been copied; it could be that they copied the white werewolf, after all. After using their ability, the Look-Alike is no longer unaligned (unless they copied an unaligned player).
Some Look-Alike special cases can be seen under `$i la cases`.

__Simplified__
During Night 1, the Look-Alike must choose one other player whose role they copy.

__Formalized__

__Card__
The Look-Alike finds somebody else and copies everything they have.
