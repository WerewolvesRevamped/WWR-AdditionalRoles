**Red Werewolf** | Solo Killing - Red Wolves | Variant
__Basics__
The Red Werewolf is a werewolf who is not satisfied with merely killing the townsfolk; they must kill all the werewolves as well. 
Every other night, the Red Werewolf may attack a member of the wolfpack or the butchers.
__Details__
To the werewolves, the Red Werewolf will appear to be a regular bloody butcher. However, it is the Red Werewolfâ€™s goal to win the game completely alone; even the other werewolves must die.
Starting with Night 2, the Red Werewolf may attack a member of the wolfpack or butchers every other night. If they choose not to attack, they will once again have the option to attack in the following night.
Attacking a member of the wolfpack or butchers is an end-night ability. 
If only werewolves and the Red Werewolf are left alive, the game will continue until either all werewolves are dead or the Red Werewolf is dead.
The Red Werewolf imitates a bloody butcher. It is strongly disguised a butcher and joins the butcher channel.
If the Red Werewolf changes role, the disguise is lost.
The Red Werewolf is not part of the werewolf team, but is still considered a lycan and is part of the wolfpack.

__Simplified__
Every other night, the Red Werewolf may attack a member of the wolfpack. The Red Werewolf is not part of the werewolf team but is part of the wolfpack.
The Red Werewolf imitates a bloody butcher and as such is disguised as a butcher and is a member of the butchers channel.
