**Look-Alike Special Cases**
By default the Look-Alike simply copies the role of the other player. In many cases the Look-Alike doesn't just copy the role, but also joins the channels of the copied role.
If a role that is part of a group is copied the Look-Alike always joins the group channels. For roles listed as 'Join' the Look-Alike additionally also joins a new group secret channel together with their copy.
For roles listed as 'Special Copy' the Look-Alike instead turns into the listed role, instead of the copied one.
