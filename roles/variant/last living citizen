**Last Living Citizen** | Solo Killing - Townsfolk Team | Variant
__Basics__
The Last Living Citizen can only be in the game when there is no townfolk team. Instead the Last Living Citizen represents the entire townsfolk team. 
__Details__
Each night the Last Living Citizen may select three townsfolk roles and will be able to use that role's abilities for the rest of the night and the following day. The Last Living Citizen can both use active and passive abilities. They may not select the same role twice in one night. If limitations apply to a role (e.g. three kills for assassin), they still apply for the Last Living Citizen (they may select Assassin as many times as they want, but can only attack three times).
When elected as Last Living Citizen the player loses their previous roles and secret channels and becomes the Last Living Citizen instead.
If there are several Last Living Citizens they work together. If there are other townsfolk-aligned players, they can win together with the Last Living Citizen.
