**Blessed Wolf** | Werewolf Miscellaneous | Mini
__Basics__
The Blessed Wolf will be protected from any night attacks to target them and will be informed how they were attacked.
__Details__
The Blessed Wolf will escape unharmed from any attacks to target it at night. They are also informed what role they were attacked by. 
If a Blessed Wolf evades an attack, the attacker is told it was due to their target being blessed.
If the Blessed Wolf is attacked several times in one night, they learn the role of each attack.

**Note:** Due to technical limitations Blessed Wolf does not start out as a pack member, even though it should be part of the pack. Notify Hosts to add you to pack if Hosts forget to manually add you.

__Simplified__
The Blessed Wolf will be protected from any night attacks to target them and will be told the roles of each attacker.
When an attacker's attack fails, they are told that it failed because the target is blessed.
