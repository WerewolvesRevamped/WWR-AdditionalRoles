**Royal Guard** | Townsfolk Power | Mini
__Basics__
The Royal Guard may cancel a lynch. Unlike the Royal Knight, the Royal Guard may do so during Day 1, and as many times as they want.
__Details__
The Royal Guard may cancel the lynch at any time of day or night, and it will apply to the current or upcoming lynch. If there are several lynches, the Royal Guard may choose any number of them, and which specific ones.
Cancelling the lynch is an immediate ability. However, the fact that the lynch has been cancelled will only be revealed at the end of the day. 
The Royal Guard also chooses whether they want to be revealed or not. If they choose to be revealed, both their role and name are announced: otherwise, neither is.

__Simplified__
The Royal Guard may cancel any number of lynches. It is an immediate ability but is only revealed at the end of the day.
They can also use this ability the night prior to a lynch if they wish to do so.
The Royal Guard can optionally choose to reveal their name alongside the announcement of the role being used.

__Formalized__
Compound:
  • Immediate: Cancel `Lynch` Poll
  • End Day: Reveal `Royal Guard @Self cancelled lynch` to #story_time
