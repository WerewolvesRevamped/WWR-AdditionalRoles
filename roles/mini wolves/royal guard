**Royal Guard** | Townsfolk Power | Mini
__Basics__
Once per game, the Royal Guard may cancel the lynch. Unlike the Royal Knight, the Royal Guard may do so during Day 1.
__Details__
The Royal Guard may cancel the lynch at any time of day or night, and it will apply to the current or upcoming lynch. If there are several lynches, the Royal Guard may only cancel one of them: they may choose which one.
Cancelling the lynch is an immediate ability. However, the fact that the lynch has been cancelled will only be revealed at the end of the day. 
The Royal Guard also chooses whether they want to be revealed or not. If they choose to be revealed, both their role and name are announced: otherwise, neither is.


__Simplified__
The Royal Guard may cancel a lynch once. It is an immediate ability but is only revealed at the end of the day.
The Royal Guard can optionally choose to reveal their name alongside the announcement of the role being used.
