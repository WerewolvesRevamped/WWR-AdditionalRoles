**Master Barber** | Townsfolk Killing | Mini
__Basics__
Once per game, the Master Barber may choose to immediately attack one player during the day. Unlike the Barber, they can do so during Day 1. 
__Details__
At any time during the day, the Master Barber may once attack another player. 
The Master Barber also chooses whether they want to be revealed or not. If they choose to be revealed both their role and name is announced, otherwise neither is.
The Master Barber’s attack is an immediate ability. If the Master Barber's attack fails, they are not revealed.

__Simplified__
The Master Barber may once per game choose to immediately attack one player during the day.
The player can optionally choose to have their name revealed with the announcement of their ability.
