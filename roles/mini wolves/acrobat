**Acrobat** | Townsfolk Miscellaneous | Mini
__Basics__
Twice per game, if attacked by a wolfish player, the Acrobat shall escape.
__Details__
When they are attacked by a wolfish player, the Acrobat will not die. 
If a Acrobat is targeted by any attack other than by a wolfish player's attack, they will die the first time.
Acrobats are informed that they were attacked. If a Acrobat evades a wolfpack attack, the wolfpack is told their target ran away. If a Acrobat evades any other attack, the wolfish player responsible is informed instead.

__Simplified__
Twice per game, if attacked by a wolfish player, the Acrobat shall escape.
Acrobats are informed that they were attacked. 
If an Acrobat evades an attack, the source of the attack is told that their target ran away.
