**Acrobat** | Townsfolk Miscellaneous | Mini
__Basics__
Twice per game, if attacked by a wolfish player, the Acrobat shall escape.
__Details__
When they are attacked by a wolfish player, the Acrobat will not die. 
If a Acrobat is targeted by any attack other than by a wolfish player's attack, they will die the first time.
Acrobats are informed that they were attacked. If a Acrobat evades a wolfpack attack, the wolfpack is told their target ran away. If a Acrobat evades any other attack, the wolfish player responsible is informed instead.
