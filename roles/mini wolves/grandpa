**Grandma** | Townsfolk Power | Mini
__Basics__
Each night, the Grandpa may choose one players. The next day, these selected player can’t vote.
__Details__
Making a player unable to vote is an immediate ability. If they still vote, their vote simply isn’t counted towards the final result. 
If the Grandpa selects a player with several votes (e.g. Mayor or Grandma), they only lose 1 of their votes, but keep the others. 
Players with negative votes or no votes can't have their negative votes stolen (and the Grandpa is informed). The Mayors extra vote cannot be stolen.
The Grandpa may select themself. The Grandpa is affected by redirections.

__Simplified__
Each night, the Grandpa can choose a player. The next day, these selected player's vote won't count.
