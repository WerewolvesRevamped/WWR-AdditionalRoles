**Grandpa** | Townsfolk Power | Mini
__Basics__
Each night, the Grandpa may choose one player. The next day, these selected player loses their vote.
__Details__
Removing a player's vote is an immediate ability. If they still vote, their vote simply isn’t counted towards the final result. 
If the Grandpa selects a player with several votes (e.g. Mayor or Grandma), they only lose 1 of their votes, but keep the others. 
Players with negative votes or no votes can't have their negative votes stolen (and the Grandpa is informed). The Mayors extra vote cannot be stolen.
The Grandpa may select themself. The Grandpa is affected by redirections.

__Simplified__
Each night, the Grandpa can choose a player. Until the end of the next day, the selected player's voting power is reduced by 1 as long as their voting power is above 0.

__Formalized__
Immediate Night:
  • Evaluate:
    ‣ @Selection->PublicVotingPower > `0`: Manipulate @Selection's `public voting power` by `-1` (~NextDay)
    ‣ Otherwise: Learn `@Selection could not be manipulated`

__Card__
Be sure to do what's best for town, or the Grandpa might fill out your ballot for you.
