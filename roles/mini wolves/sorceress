**Sorceress** | Townsfolk Power | Mini
__Basics__
The Sorceress chooses one person each day. If the target is a Townsfolk roles, the target can do their ability twice next time they do their ability.
__Detailed__
The Sorceress's ability only affects Townsfolk roles. If used on a member of the werewolf team, the Sorceress loses her ability for the rest of the game. If used on a Solo or Unaligned, nothing happens.
The Sorceress is an end-day ability. They will be notified if it was successful or if they lost their powers. The target will be notified that they were targeted by a Sorceress, even if they are not a Townsfolk role.
The Sorceress ability does not affect other Sorceresses or roles without a repeatable action (such as Hooker).
