**Look-Alike Special Cases**
By default the Look-Alike simply copies the role of the other player.
If a role that is part of a group is copied the Look-Alike always joins the group channels.
For some roles, the Look-Alike instead turns into the listed role below, instead of the copied one.

<?CultLeader:> Cult Leader => <?CultMember:> Cult Member
<?Devil:> Devil, Cerberus => <?Demon:> Demon
<?PlagueBearer:> Plague Bearer => <?PlagueCarrier:> Plague Carrier
<?Shepherd:> *Shepherd => <?HerdingDog:> Herding Dog*
<?Reaper:> *Reaper => <?Immortal:> Immortal*
